        <p class="mt-2">
          Born in Brooklyn in 1870, Vaseline® is now present in over 70 countries and celebrated as one of the top hand
          and body brands globally.

            The Vaseline® brand was built on the healing efficacy of Vaseline® Jelly. Formulated in 1870, this “Wonder
            Jelly” has been healing dry skin for over 150 years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, what started with a jar of Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly has grown into an expansive product portfolio
            that includes Vaseline® Intensive Care™ Lotions and Vaseline® Lip Therapy™. However, the restorative power
            of Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly can still be found inside the products that Vaseline® makes. We invite you to
            go back in time and learn the origins of the Vaseline® brand, and how after a century of restoring skin it
            became one of the most celebrated skin care brands around the world.

              Robert Augustus Chesebrough, a 22-year-old chemist, traveled to Titusville, Pennsylvania and
              discovered something amazing. He learned about a natural, waxy ingredient, rich in minerals
              from deep within the earth, which had visible skin-repairing properties.
