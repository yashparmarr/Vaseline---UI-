                        The Vaseline® brand was built on the healing efficacy of Vaseline® Jelly. Formulated in 1870, this “Wonder Jelly” has been healing dry skin for over 150 years.

                    <p>
                        Today, what started with a jar of Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly has grown into an expansive product portfolio that includes Vaseline® Intensive Care™ Lotions and Vaseline® Lip Therapy™. However, the restorative power of Vaseline® Petroleum Jelly can still be found inside the products that Vaseline® makes. We invite you to go back in time and learn the origins of the Vaseline® brand, and how after a century of restoring skin it became one of the most celebrated skin care brands around the world.
