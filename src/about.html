              Vaseline’s® skin health credentials stem from the original
              Vaseline® Jelly, which sits at the center of our product
              portfolio and also at the center of our social mission program,
              <span>The Vaseline® Healing Project</span>. Every product we
              make promotes healthy skin either by healing, protecting, or
              reversing and preventing skin dryness. Whether it's Vaseline®
              Protecting Jelly to help with minor scrapes or Vaseline® Derma
              Care Advance Repair Lotion to soothe very dry skin, we create
              highly researched, scientific formulas that everyone can use.Our
              product ranges include products that moisturize skin to make it
              more resilient and give you that natural, healthy-looking glow
