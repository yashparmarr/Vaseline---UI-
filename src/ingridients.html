                            effective protection and moisturization, while promoting skin barrier recovery. How? It
                            penetrates the skin layers and then re-crystallizes, replacing lipids and boosting the
                            skin's ability to repair itself. It not only protects but also helps your skin’s healing

                            <p>An occlusive moisturizer forms a physical barrier on the top layer of our skin that
                                prevents
                                moisture loss. Occlusives seal in the water, so it doesn't evaporate. It makes skin feel
                                soft and smooth and can also relieve irritation like itching or burning. The degree of
                                occlusivity of Petrolatum Jelly is unique as it gives effective protection and
                                moisturization, while aiding barrier recovery.
